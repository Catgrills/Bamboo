About
-------------------------------

Bamboo-X is a custom stylesheet for exhentai.

A custom stylesheet (or userstyles) is a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff.

Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Install Stylish</strong>

<span>Depending of your browser.</span>
<ol>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/">Opera</a></li>
<li>for <a href="http://sobolev.us/stylish/">Safari</a></li>
<li> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.pmmlabs.stylish&amp;hl=en">Dolphin</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 2 : Install the script </strong>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://pastebin.com/rECzzV0i">manually</a> : create a new style in Stylish and copy/paste the script in it. The script was written for Firefox Mozilla, that's why for Google Chrome and such, you'll have to click the button <i>Import from Mozilla.</i></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3 : Install the font </strong>

I use several fonts for my custom stylesheet.
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/neuton">Neuton</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a> (make sure to install Roboto Condensed)</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/">Bokutachi no Gothic 2 </a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 4 : Show your appreciation </strong>
<ol>
<li>Feel free to comment this submission (critique, suggestion, compliment, etc).</li>
<li>If you like my works, don't hesitate to watch me.</li>
<li>You can share it, but don't forget to mention me.</li>
</ol>

Trivia
-------------------------------

I decided to name the script <i>Bamboo-X</i> because some anon suggested it to me (because Panda loves Bambo, right ?). The <i>X</i> comes from the famous slogan of Exhentai <i>The X Makes It Sound Cool</i>, and I used this letter to differenciate it with my previous Exhentai script called <i>Bamboo</i>.


Report
-------------------------------

If you find some elements that weren't tweaked or that you simply want to modify or re-add an element that was removed, don't hesitate to report it in the comments.
